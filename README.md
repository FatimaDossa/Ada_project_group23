# Ada_project_group23 : Graph Mining Healthcare Approach: Analysis and Recommendation
# Project Overview
This project explores the use of frequent subgraph mining (FSM) and discriminative subgraph mining (DSM) for healthcare recommendation systems, specifically leveraging the MIMIC dataset. The goal is to apply graph mining techniques to improve predictive analytics in medical data, aiding in patient recovery recommendations.

# Motivation
This project is driven by our interest in healthcare applications and the opportunity to understand graph algorithms by applying them to real-world problems. By implementing subgraph mining techniques, we aim to explore predictive analytics in medical data for patient recovery recommendations.
